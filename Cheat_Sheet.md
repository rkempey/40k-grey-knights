  - At the end of your Movement phase, this model can repair one friendly GREY KNIGHTS VEHICLE model within 3" of it. That VEHICLE model regains up to D3 lost wounds. Each model can only be repaired once per turn.

## Psyhic Phase

  - Warp charge 6 - If manifested then gain 1 CP
- Then start casting Purifying Ritual to score secondary points (see below)
  - Warp charge 5 - If manifested then gain Victory Points. 
- Decide on if Gate of Infinity is a good play
- Ensure Smite is being used, etc...

## Shooting Phase
- Any CORE units within 6" of KALDOR DRAIGO?
